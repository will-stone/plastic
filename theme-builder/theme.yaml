# Your theme's name must begin with Plastic, e.g. Plastic Horses
name: Plastic

# Your theme must provide hex values for these 6 normal and 6 bright colours.
# The terminal colours they are associated with is shown next to them. The
# colour you set does not necessarily need to match the terminal name, they are
# your available palette for your syntax colours. Do not add, remove, or rename
# the palette names. I highly recommend the Color Highlight plugin that will
# make it easier to see which colours your palette is using.

# Plastic themes most of the workbench (everything that's not syntax) for you.
# However, there are a couple of flourishes you can add to top-off your
# theme nicely. As with syntax, use the palette identifier.
ui:
  primary: sunglo # buttons, activity-bar badge
  secondary: cornflower_blue # find highlight, bracket match etc.
  warning: harvest_gold # squiggly underlines, find match errors etc.
  error: cinnabar # squiggly underlines, find match errors etc.
  borders: bunker # borders that separate the panels, sidebars, tabs etc.
  background: shark # editor, titlebar, and activity bar background
  panels: woodsmoke # sidebar, terminal, inactive tabs etc.
  text_subtle: shuttle_gray # line numbers, muted items
  text: cadet_blue
  text_active: iron # active tab, active line number, active list text etc.
  highlight: cadet_blue_1A # ui flourishes: whitespace, indent guide, ruler, line highlight
  highlight_active: cadet_blue_33 # active indent guide, selection, search match
  highlight_border: iron # search match borders

# And that's all there is to it. Run `yarn` and then `yarn build-vscode` and
# your new theme will be written to `./vscode/themes/`
